## Architecture

The codebase follows the Clean Architecture principles for Android, organizing the app into:

- **Presentation Classes (Fragments and ViewModels)**
- **Use Cases**
- **Repositories**
- **Data Sources**

## Technologies Used

## Notes

The app is currently in beta, and as such, may have some bugs:

- After creating or joining a room, there's no option to leave. To do so, clear the app's storage and cache in the device settings.
- When reopening the app, it will navigate to the correct screen based on your last action (e.g., returning to a room). However, this navigation is not optimized and may lead to unexpected situations.

Your feedback is crucial as we refine and enhance the SongMatch experience! ðŸŽµ
